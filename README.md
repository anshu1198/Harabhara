# Hara Bhara - Gamified Sustainability Platform

![Hara Bhara Screenshot](./public/homepage_ss.png)

## Overview
I created **Hara Bhara** because I wanted to turn real-world eco-actions into a game. I believe that saving the planet should be fun and rewarding, so I built this platform to convert sustainable habits into "Gbits" (Green bits).

I designed the application to track activities like recycling, tree planting, and energy conservation. My goal was to move away from boring self-reporting and instead use a gamified approach with streaks, levels, and leaderboards to keep users engaged.

## How I Built It
I developed this using a modern tech stack to ensure it looks great and performs well:
- **Next.js** for the core framework and routing.
- **TailwindCSS** for the styling (I focused on a dark, premium aesthetic).
- **React** for the interactive components.

## Key Features I Created
- **Gamified Dashboard**: I built a central hub where users can see their Gbits, verified actions, and current streak.
- **Game Layer**: I added daily quests and a leaderboard system to foster friendly competition.
- **Verification System**: I designed a "Hybrid verification" model that combines self-reporting with IoT/hardware inputs (like smart bins).
- **Impact Tracking**: Users can see exactly how their actions contribute to the community's goals.

## How to Run
I made it easy to start the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
